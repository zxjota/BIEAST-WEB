    <h2 id="info-we-collect">1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>We collect information to provide and improve the Service. The types of information may include:</p>
    <h3>1.1 Information You Provide to Us</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Fuel and vehicle records:</strong> entries you add such as fuel volume, price, total cost, odometer readings, station name, notes, and photos/receipts (if you upload them).</li>
      <li><strong>Account information (if you create an account):</strong> name/username, email address, password (stored using industry-standard hashing).</li>
      <li><strong>Support communications:</strong> information you include in emails or in-app support requests.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>1.2 Information Collected Automatically</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Device and usage data:</strong> app version, device model, operating system, language, time zone, crash logs, performance diagnostics, and interaction data (e.g., screens viewed, feature usage).</li>
      <li><strong>Approximate location:</strong> if you enable location features (e.g., to tag nearby stations), we may collect approximate location from your device settings. You can disable this at any time in your device or app settings.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>1.3 Information from Third Parties</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Analytics and crash reporting providers:</strong> aggregated or pseudonymized insights to help us improve stability and performance.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="how-we-use">2. How We Use Information</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Provide, operate, and maintain the Service, including saving your fuel entries and generating insights (e.g., cost per fill, mileage, trends).</li>
      <li>Improve and personalize features, such as suggestions or quick-fill defaults.</li>
      <li>Monitor performance, troubleshoot issues, and enhance security.</li>
      <li>Communicate with you about updates, changes, and support.</li>
      <li>Comply with legal obligations and enforce our terms.</li>
      <li><em>Optional:</em> If you explicitly opt in, send non-essential product tips or newsletters (you can opt out at any time).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="legal-bases">3. Legal Bases (EEA/UK Only)</h2>
    <p>If you are located in the European Economic Area or the United Kingdom, we process personal data under these legal bases:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Performance of a contract:</strong> to provide the Service you request.</li>
      <li><strong>Legitimate interests:</strong> to maintain and improve the Service, secure it, and prevent abuse, balanced against your rights.</li>
      <li><strong>Consent:</strong> for optional features such as precise location or marketing communications, where required. You may withdraw consent at any time.</li>
      <li><strong>Legal obligations:</strong> to comply with applicable laws.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="sharing">4. How We Share Information</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Service providers:</strong> we may share information with vetted vendors who perform services on our behalf (e.g., analytics, cloud hosting, crash reporting) under contractual confidentiality obligations.</li>
      <li><strong>Legal and safety:</strong> we may disclose information to comply with law, legal process, or to protect the rights, property, or safety of our users or others.</li>
      <li><strong>Business transfers:</strong> in connection with a merger, acquisition, or asset sale, your information may be transferred subject to this Policy or a successor policy with notice to you where required.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>We do not sell your personal information</strong> and we do not “share” it for cross-context behavioral advertising as defined by U.S. state privacy laws.</p>

    <h2 id="retention">5. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>We retain personal information only as long as necessary to provide the Service, comply with legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce agreements. You may delete your account or specific entries at any time within the app (where available) or by contacting us. We will complete deletion subject to any legal retention requirements and reasonable backup/archival cycles.</p>

    <h2 id="security">6. Security</h2>
    <p>We use reasonable administrative, technical, and organizational measures to protect your information (for example, encryption in transit, hashed passwords). No method of transmission or storage is 100% secure; we cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>

    <h2 id="rights">7. Your Privacy Rights</h2>
    <p>Your rights may vary based on your location.</p>
    <h3>7.1 United States (including California/CPRA and other states)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Right to know/access what categories and specific pieces of personal information we have collected about you.</li>
      <li>Right to deletion, subject to certain exceptions.</li>
      <li>Right to correct inaccurate personal information.</li>
      <li>Right to opt out of sales or sharing for cross-context behavioral advertising (not applicable as we do not sell/share as defined).</li>
      <li>Right to non-discrimination for exercising your rights.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You or your authorized agent can exercise rights by emailing <a href="mailto:awacleanifyapp@gmail.com">awacleanifyapp@gmail.com</a>. We may need to verify your identity before fulfilling a request.</p>

    <h3>7.2 EEA/UK</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Right of access, rectification, erasure, and data portability.</li>
      <li>Right to restrict or object to processing based on legitimate interests.</li>
      <li>Right to withdraw consent at any time where processing is based on consent.</li>
      <li>Right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>7.3 Managing Choices</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Location:</strong> disable location permissions in your device settings to stop location collection.</li>
      <li><strong>Marketing emails:</strong> use the unsubscribe link in the message or contact us.</li>
      <li><strong>Account/data deletion:</strong> use in-app controls (if available) or email us.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="children">8. Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>The Service is not directed to children under 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you believe a child has provided us personal information, contact us and we will take appropriate steps to delete it.</p>

    <h2 id="dnt">9. Do Not Track</h2>
    <p>Your browser may offer a “Do Not Track” signal. Because there is no industry consensus, we do not respond to DNT signals. We do, however, honor applicable opt-out rights under relevant privacy laws.</p>

    <h2 id="intl">10. International Transfers</h2>
    <p>We may process and store information in countries other than your own. Where required, we implement appropriate safeguards (such as standard contractual clauses) to protect personal data transferred internationally.</p>

    <h2 id="changes">11. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. The “Effective date” above indicates when the latest changes took effect. Material changes will be notified within the app or by email when appropriate.</p>

    <h2 id="contact">12. Contact Us</h2>
